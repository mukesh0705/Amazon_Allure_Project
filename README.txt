Allure Report
============================================

We would be following the below steps for creating and viewing Allure Reports.Create a New Maven 
Project and Update pom.xml with required Dependencies.There are several elements in the POM.XML file. The <project>is the root element. The <modelVersion> specifies the model version while the <version> specifies the version of the artifact under the given group.

artifactid: An XML element in the POM.xml of a Maven project that specifies the id of the Project (artifact)
Now add below-mentioned dependencies in Pom.xml file

TestNG — Java testing framework.
Selenium java — To automate browser.
Allure-TestNG — To generate the report. 

Copy the maven dependencies for allure-testng. I have used the 2.13.0 version

=>TestNG- Java testing framework
=>Selenium java- To automate browser
=>Allure-TestNG- To generate the report. 

2. Download Allure Binaries then set path.

   The Next Step is to generate “Allure Report”. we need to download allure binaries from maven.
   Copy and launch bellow link in your browser and click on this 'allure-commandline-2.13.0.zip' File link'   

   https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/qameta/allure/allure-commandline/2.13.0/ 


3. Check Allure version.

   Download the zip file , unzip the file in the desired location. Copy the location up to bin folder,
   add it to Environment variables to path system variable just like you did for maven.
   Now Verify Allure Binaries are configured properly or not, open command prompt and check for version.
                               allure --version

4. Create TestNG TestCases then run through TestNG.XML

   Once the test scripts execution has completed. Go to Your Project and refresh it After refreshing 
   Project automatically one folder is generated <allure-results> if you expand it you can see many 
   JSON files.

5. Then, run below command in Windows command prompt:

   To see Report run Below Mentioned steps, Right click on <allure-results> folder > Properties>copy 
   folder path.

   open Command Prompt
   Run This Command- allure serve <folder-path>

Up till now, we have seen basics to generate allure report, now we will see How to customize it by 
adding different types of annotations and also, we will how to add a screenshot on failure Test cases.

Here, is the annotations from Allure

@Epic : Epics are useful as placeholders for large requirements for your product or project. Epic 
will be divided into smaller user stories at the appropriate time.

@Stories/@Story : A User Story can be split to smaller Tasks, and can be part of some larger Feature 
and Epic.

@Severity : In allure, we can define any @Test with @Severity annotation with any of these values 
like BLOCKER, CRITICAL, NORMAL, MINOR, TRIVIAL. By looking at this, we can understand the Severity of 
test if Failed.

@Description(“In this cool test we will check cool thing”) : We can add detailed description for each 
test method/class using @Description annotation

@Step : We can annotate any method with any visibility modifier (public, private, protected) with 
@Step annotation. Ex — @Step(“Entering {0} and {1}”)

@Attachment : An attachment is simply a method that returns either a String or byte[], which should 
be added to the report.

@Link : We can link tests to some resources such as TMS (test management system) or bug tracker. 
This is always helpful to link test cases to the test method.

Note:-These annotations are used in the same way like we use TestNG annotations like that

          @Test
          @Epic
          @Stories/@Story
          @Severity
          @Description(“In this cool test we will check cool thing”)
          @Step(“Entering {0} and {1}”)
          @Link
          
==============================================================================================================================================
This type of Report link generated by cmd command but this link will be changes dynamically every time when Test cases executed
